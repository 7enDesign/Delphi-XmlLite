Delphi-XmlLite
==============

Header translation for Microsoft XmlLite

* XmlLite is a native C++ implementation of .NET XmlReader+Writer which do stream-based, forward-only XML parsing and creation.
* XmlLite.dll is required.  It is included with all new versions of Windows, and service packs for old versions.
* XmlReader's pull-based interface is cleaner to use than SAX's event-based interface.

Note: This is a minimal translation, some parts were not implemented and most are untested.
